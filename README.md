# Smashing Pumpkin
Smashing Pumpkin is a server multiplayer game. 

## The Idea
Idea came up quite easily. The Game Jam was during the Halloween and we have decided to create a game related to that holiday

## Gameplay
Smashing Pumpkin is server multiplayer game which can be played by 2 gamers. The idea is that the player has to pick up as much as possible pumpkins during certain time and throw them to the place to collect them. But be carefull, some pumpkins can randomly explode

The game was build during the GameJam in a team of 3 people.
For building the game our team has decided to move with Unity3d engine, because it's pretty popular and there are lots of useful sources.

For building this project we were using:
  * Unity3d and C#
  * Blender - for effects
  * Photon - as a web server
